# Kinemotion Specialized Agents Guide

This guide explains how Claude Code's specialized agents work in the Kinemotion project and how to use them effectively.

## Quick Start: Automatic Routing

Claude Code automatically selects the right agent based on:

1. **Keywords** in your message
2. **File paths** you're working with
3. **Context** from the conversation

You don't need to manually select agents - Claude does it for you!

### Example Scenarios

#### Pose Detection Issue

**You say:** "The hip landmarks aren't being detected properly"

**What happens:**

- Claude detects keywords: "landmarks", "detected"
- Automatically routes to: **computer-vision-engineer**
- Agent analyzes MediaPipe settings and video quality
- Returns debugging steps and solutions

#### Metric Validation

**You say:** "Is an RSI of 3.8 realistic for this jump?"

**What happens:**

- Claude detects keywords: "RSI", "realistic"
- Automatically routes to: **biomechanics-specialist**
- Agent validates against biomechanical research
- Returns physiological assessment

#### Performance Problem

**You say:** "The video processing is taking too long"

**What happens:**

- Claude detects keywords: "performance", "taking too long"
- Automatically routes to: **python-backend-developer**
- Agent profiles code and identifies bottlenecks
- Returns optimization recommendations

#### Add New Feature

**You say:** "Add countermovement depth to CMJ analysis"

**What happens:**

- Claude recognizes this needs multiple agents
- **Biomechanics Specialist**: Defines metric biomechanically
- **Python Backend Developer**: Implements calculation
- **QA Test Engineer**: Creates tests
- **Technical Writer**: Documents the API

## Explicit Agent Invocation

You can also explicitly request a specific agent:

```bash
# Single agent
Use the computer-vision-engineer agent to debug pose detection

# Multiple agents
Use biomechanics-specialist to define the metric, then python-backend-developer to implement it

# Chain of agents
Have qa-test-engineer create tests, then have technical-writer document the feature
```

## View Available Agents

```bash
/agents
```

This opens an interactive menu showing:

- All available agents
- Their descriptions and expertise
- Tools they have access to
- Options to create, edit, or delete agents

## Testing Agent Routing

Try these example requests to see automatic routing in action:

### Computer Vision Engineer

```
"The pose landmarks are jittery in this video"
"How do I handle video rotation from mobile phones?"
"What MediaPipe confidence threshold should I use?"
```

### Biomechanics Specialist

```
"How should I calculate jump height from flight time?"
"Is triple extension measured at takeoff or peak?"
"What's a typical RSI range for trained athletes?"
```

### Python Backend Developer

```
"This loop is slow, can we vectorize it?"
"How can I reduce code duplication in the analysis modules?"
"What's the best way to structure this API?"
```

### ML/Data Scientist

```
"What filter cutoff frequency should I use?"

"What parameters should I use for validation?"
```

### DevOps/CI-CD Engineer

```

"What edge cases should I test?"
"How do I improve coverage for this module?"
```

## How Agents Work

### Agent Capabilities

Each agent:

- Has a **custom system prompt** with specialized knowledge
- **Limited tool access** for security and focus
- Operates in a **separate context** to preserve main conversation
- Returns results to the main conversation

### Agent Configuration

Agents are configured with YAML frontmatter in `.claude/agents/`:

```yaml
---
name: agent-name
description: When this agent should be used (automatic routing)
tools: Read, Edit, Write, Bash, Grep, Glob  # Optional
model: sonnet  # Optional: sonnet, opus, haiku, or inherit
---

System prompt and instructions...
```

#### Key Configuration Fields

- **name**: Unique identifier (lowercase-with-hyphens)
- **description**: Clear description triggering automatic routing
  - Use **"Use PROACTIVELY"** to encourage automatic use
  - Use **"MUST BE USED"** for mandatory routing
- **tools**: Comma-separated list (omit to inherit all tools)
- **model**: Model to use (defaults to sonnet if omitted)

## Agent Coordination

For complex tasks requiring multiple specialties:

### Sequential Handoff (one after another)

```
Use biomechanics-specialist to define metric,
  then python-backend-developer to implement,
  then qa-test-engineer to test,
  then technical-writer to document
```

### Parallel Consultation (independent work)

```
Have computer-vision-engineer check pose quality
  while qa-test-engineer creates tests
(Results combined)
```

### Validation Chain (implementation → review → docs)

```
python-backend-developer implements
  → qa-test-engineer tests
  → technical-writer documents
```

## Example Workflows

### Workflow 1: Pose Detection Issue

**User:** "Landmarks are jittery in the video"

**Automatic Routing:** Computer Vision Engineer

**Steps:**

1. Agent analyzes video quality and lighting
2. Checks MediaPipe confidence thresholds
3. Recommends filtering parameters
4. May consult ML/Data Scientist for parameter tuning

### Workflow 2: Add New Metric

**User:** "Add countermovement depth to CMJ analysis"

**Automatic Routing:** Multi-agent coordination

**Steps:**

1. Biomechanics Specialist defines metric biomechanically
2. Python Backend Developer implements calculation
3. QA Test Engineer creates tests
4. Technical Writer documents API and usage

### Workflow 3: Performance Issue

**User:** "Video processing is too slow"

**Automatic Routing:** Python Backend Developer

**Steps:**

1. Agent profiles code to find bottleneck
2. Applies NumPy vectorization
3. May consult Computer Vision Engineer for video I/O
4. QA Test Engineer validates no regression

## Best Practices

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each agent should have one clear focus
2. **Detailed Prompts**: Include specific instructions, examples, constraints
3. **Limited Tools**: Only grant necessary tools for the agent's purpose
4. **Clear Descriptions**: Make automatic routing triggers obvious
5. **Version Control**: Commit agents to git for team sharing

### Tips for Best Results

1. **Be specific**: "The hip landmarks are jittery" vs "Something is wrong"
2. **Mention file names**: "Check src/kinemotion/core/pose.py"
3. **Use domain terms**: "RSI", "MediaPipe", "vectorize", "pytest"
4. **Let Claude choose**: Trust automatic routing for most tasks
5. **Explicit when needed**: Use explicit invocation for edge cases

## Managing Agents

### View All Agents

```bash
/agents
```

### Create New Agent

```bash
/agents  # Select "Create New Agent"
```

**Recommended:** Generate with Claude first, then customize.

### Edit Agent

You can edit agent files directly in `.claude/agents/` or use:

```bash
/agents  # Select agent to edit
```

## Troubleshooting

### Agent Not Auto-Selected

If Claude doesn't automatically use an agent:

1. Check if keywords match agent's `description` field
2. Be more specific in your request
3. Explicitly invoke the agent by name

### Agent Lacks Required Tools

If agent reports missing tools:

1. Open `/agents` interface
2. Select the agent
3. Add required tools to the `tools` field

### Agent Provides Incorrect Guidance

1. Review agent's system prompt
2. Edit to clarify instructions
3. Add specific examples or constraints

## Contributing New Agents

When creating new agents:

1. Identify a clear, focused responsibility
2. Define automatic routing triggers in `description`
3. Grant minimal necessary tools
4. Write detailed system prompt with examples
5. Test automatic routing with example scenarios
6. Document in this guide
7. Commit to version control
