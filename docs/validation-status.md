# Validation Status

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** 2025-01-13
**Status:** Pre-validation

______________________________________________________________________

## Executive Summary

Kinemotion is a **pre-validation** tool that has not been validated against gold standard measurement systems (force plates, 3D motion capture). While the implementation is technically sophisticated and biomechanically sound, it **lacks empirical validation** required for research or clinical use.

**Bottom Line:** Use kinemotion for training monitoring and exploratory analysis. Do not use for research publications, clinical decisions, or any context requiring validated accuracy.

## Current Validation Efforts (AthletePose3D)

We are currently in **Phase 1** of a multi-stage validation study using the **AthletePose3D (AP3D)** dataset, which contains high-speed athletic movements captured by research-grade multi-camera systems.

### 🧪 Methodology Highlights

To transition from 2D pixel-based analysis to research-grade 3D kinematics, we are implementing:

1. **Coordinate Normalization:** Using Procrustes Analysis (Kabsch Algorithm) to align MediaPipe detections with physical world coordinates (mm).
2. **3D Joint Angles:** Reconstructing anatomical angles (Hip, Knee, Ankle) in 3D space to correct for camera perspective and foreshortening.

For detailed technical analysis of why these steps matter for monocular video and how they are implemented, see the [AthletePose3D Methodology Guide](validation/athletepose3d-methodology.md).

______________________________________________________________________

## Known Limitations

### 1. No Gold Standard Validation

**Issue:** Never compared against force plates or optical motion capture
**Impact:** Unknown accuracy, cannot make quantitative accuracy claims
**Mitigation:** Validation study planned (see roadmap)

### 2. MediaPipe Pose Estimation Constraints

**Issue:** MediaPipe validated for clinical joint angles (Armstrong et al., 2025) but NOT for jump performance metrics
**Limitations documented in research:**

- Affected by lighting conditions
- Reduced accuracy with loose clothing
- Jitter from self-occlusion
- Not optimized for high-speed ballistic movements

**Impact:** Tracking quality varies with recording conditions
**Mitigation:** Quality indicators and confidence scores (planned)

### 3. Lower Sampling Rate

**Issue:** Typical video (30-60fps) vs validated apps (120-240Hz)
**Impact:** Lower temporal resolution may reduce accuracy for rapid movements
**Comparison:**

- MyJump validated: 120Hz
- MyJumpLab validated: 240Hz
- Kinemotion typical: 30-60fps (2-4× lower)

**Mitigation:** Sub-frame interpolation, recommend 60fps minimum

### 4. Indirect Measurement Method

**Issue:** Landmarks → CoM estimation → velocity → phase detection
**Impact:** Error propagation through processing pipeline
**Comparison:**

- MyJump: Direct feet tracking → flight time
- Kinemotion: Landmarks → CoM → kinematic calculation (more steps = more error)

**Mitigation:** Robust filtering, outlier detection, physics checks

### 5. No Systematic Bias Correction

**Issue:** Bishop et al. (2022) showed correction factors needed for time-to-take-off when comparing manual vs automated detection
**Impact:** May have uncorrected systematic bias
**Example from Bishop 2022:**

- Raw TTTO had bias vs force plate
- Correction equation: `y = 0.8947x + 0.1507` eliminated bias

**Mitigation:** Correction factors will be derived after validation study
